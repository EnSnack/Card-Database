# Fake TCG Card Database (WIP)
I like TCGs, most notably online ones, because they allow for crazy creativity in mixing and matching cards and archetypes.

These cards are merely ideas for some design ideas I have. It's a constant WIP because I may suddenly have an idea for an archetype and just start designing cards for it.

Below you will find explanations on the current keywords of the archetype, this will eventually be visible on the site as well.

## Keywords
### Creation
A card has been forged into creation. This card has just been played on the battlefield, that is, this card's cost has been paid and has been put down. Upon this happening, activate the text on the card that starts with Creation.

### Destruction
A card has been dealt its final blow. This card has been destroyed by some means, may it be taking more damage than health, or a card that may destroy other cards. Upon this happening, activate the text on the card that starts with Destruction.

Please note that cards may be removed from the battlefield *without* being destroyed. Should this happen, destruction does not activate.

### Existence
A card has been weaved into existence. In this TCG, cards only exist as long as they can be viewed by some party. Upon drawing this card, or in any other way viewing this card's existence, activate the text on the card that starts with Existence.

### Activate
A card is ready for its final stand. This card is on the battlefield and your turn has just started. Upon your turn starting, activate is one of the first phases, all cards' activation happens at this point in order of left to right, therefore play order is highly important.

## Archetypes (so far)
### Witches
Sinister, the sisters snicker at the destruction and chaos they cause along the way. They care not for each other, or for anyone else, and do whatever they must to keep themselves alive, and take the enemy down in the process. Witches come in many colours, but notably of all, they come in many evils. The witch archetype plays very selfishly, destroying each other for own merits or becoming more powerful the more they destroy, but they're not necessarily entirely selfish, some summon implings that, while weak, can snowball out of control.

### Demons
Evil can come in many shapes, oftenmost however, they come in the shapes of the most demonic creatures you can imagine.
