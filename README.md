# Fake TCG Card Database (WIP)
I like TCGs, most notably online ones, because they allow for crazy creativity in mixing and matching cards and archetypes.

These cards are merely ideas for some design ideas I have. It's a constant WIP because I may suddenly have an idea for an archetype and just start designing cards for it.

Below you will find explanations on the current keywords of the archetype, this will eventually be visible on the site as well.

## Unique Mechanics
### The Fog
The Lands of [...] are vile, disgusting, and for most, uninhabitable, and yet upon it exists creatures of all sorts. At the end of every round, cards react to the fog depending on their "fog faction". In these lands exist three primary livelihoods that all take different stances to the aforementioned mechanic of the fog:

#### Fogwalkers
Fogwalkers were either born in the fog, or shaped by it. These creatures are so far gone from any similarity to humans that the only shred of humanity left in their bodies is their eternal hunger for exploration in the everchanging [...]. Some of these creatures still have their senses and walk the earth with regrets in search of family, friends, or just anyone willing to impart hospitality to them. Fogwalkers born in the fog often see those shaped by it as foreign monsters, and do not see them as brethren. The Fogwalkers' very nature of the fog allows them to heal instead of taking damage from the fog.

#### Fogbenders
Fogbenders have spent centuries and generations learning to bend the very nature of the fog to their will.

## Keywords
### Creation
A card has been forged into creation. This card has just been played on the battlefield, that is, this card's cost has been paid and has been put down. Upon this happening, activate the text on the card that starts with Creation.

### Destruction
A card has been dealt its final blow. This card has been destroyed by some means, may it be taking more damage than health, or a card that may destroy other cards. Upon this happening, activate the text on the card that starts with Destruction.

Please note that cards may be removed from the battlefield *without* being destroyed. Should this happen, destruction does not activate.

### Existence
A card has been weaved into existence. In this TCG, cards only exist as long as they can be viewed by some party. Upon drawing this card, or in any other way viewing this card's existence, activate the text on the card that starts with Existence.

### Activate
A card is ready for its final stand. This card is on the battlefield and your turn has just started. Upon your turn starting, activate is one of the first phases, all cards' activation happens at this point in order of left to right, therefore play order is highly important.

## Archetypes (so far)
### Witches
Sinister, the sisters snicker at the destruction and chaos they cause along the way. They care not for each other, nor for anyone else, and do whatever they must to keep themselves alive, and take down the enemy in the process. Witches come in many flavours, but notably of all, they come in many types of evil. The witch archetype plays mostly very selfishly, destroying each other for their own merits or becoming more powerful the more they destruction they cause, but they're not necessarily entirely selfish, some summon implings that, while weak, can snowball out of control.

### Nomads
The Nomads, a humble and noble people, yet with ulterior motives. Their innate ability to foresee that which does not yet exist makes most of their power, but some Nomads have abandoned this path in search of higher powers. Nomads play by allowing the player to peer at that which is unexisting, their unique card keyword of Peer allows them to peer at the top three cards of their graveyard or their deck, weaving any creature found into existance, thus working well with cards with the existence keyword.
